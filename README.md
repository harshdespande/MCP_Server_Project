# 🧠 Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP) — Certification & Practical Implementation

This repository documents my learning, hands-on work, and certification progress for **Anthropic’s “Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)”** course.  
The MCP framework enables developers to build powerful AI-integrated applications by connecting Claude to tools, resources, and workflows.

## 🔍 What I Learned

### ✔ MCP Server Primitives

#### **1. Tools — Model-Controlled**
Tools allow Claude to autonomously perform actions.  
Used for extending the model’s abilities, such as executing code, retrieving data, or performing custom operations.

#### **2. Resources — App-Controlled**
Resources are fetched and managed by the application.  
They are perfect for:
- Populating UI elements  
- Retrieving data  
- Adding context to model conversations  

#### **3. Prompts — User-Controlled**
Prompts are predefined workflows triggered by the user through:
- Buttons  
- Slash commands  
- Menu options

## 🛠 Practical Skills Gained

- Built a **working MCP server** from scratch  
- Used **MCP Inspector** to connect, inspect, debug, and validate server behavior  
- Understood how Claude interacts with:
  - Tools  
  - Resources  
  - Prompts  
- Learned how MCP powers real features like:
  - Workflow automation  
  - Document/context injection  
  - Application-integrated model actions

## 🧪 MCP Inspector Setup & Usage

I used **MCP Inspector** to:

- Validate server configuration  
- Monitor tool/resource/prompt registration  
- Test tool invocations  
- View live server logs and responses  

This helped me understand the full request–response flow inside an MCP environment.


## 🚀 Technologies & Tools Used
